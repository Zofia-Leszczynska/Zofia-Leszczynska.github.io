# Static site generators

To publish your documentation on GitHub Pages, you don't have to create the HTML files yourself. You can use static site generator, that is, a software application that creates HTML pages from templates or components and a given content source. Most static site generators accept files written in Markdown. 

## Jekyll

Jekyll is a static site generator. If you use GitHub Pages, Jekyll would be a good option, because it is integrated with GitHub. 

### Configuring Jekyll

If you don't want to create the set of files needed to generate the page yourself, you can use a template. One of the Jekyll templates is Just the Docs. To use it, you can copy the ***just-the-docs*** repository on GitHub from ***pmarsceill*** account.
