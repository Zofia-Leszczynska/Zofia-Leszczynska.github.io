# Static site generators

To publish your documentation on GitHub Pages, you don't have to create the HTML files yourself. You can use static site generator, that is, a software application that creates HTML pages from templates or components and a given content source. Most static site generators accept files written in Markdown. 

## Jekyll

Jekyll is a static site generator. If you use GitHub Pages, Jekyll would be a good option, because it is integrated with GitHub.

5. Click ***Code***.
6. Select ***Open with GitHub Desktop***.

To prepare your repository for configuration, perform the following actions:

1. Open your repository in VS Code.
2. In the top left corner click ***File***, then select ***Add Folder to Workspace...***
3. Select ***just-the-docs*** and click ***Add***. Now you should see your repository and ***just-the-docs*** in the Workspace in the left sidebar.

To configure your repository, perform following actions:

1. Copy the file ***_config.yml*** from ***just-the-docs*** to your repository.
